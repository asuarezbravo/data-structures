## Importance of Data Structures in Databases

In database systems, data structures are essential for efficient data storage, retrieval, and indexing. They allow databases to handle large volumes of data and perform operations quickly, especially in tasks such as search, insertions, and updates.

### Common Data Structures in Databases

1. **B-Trees and B+ Trees**: Used in indexing to allow fast data access.
2. **Hash Tables**: For quick lookups and primary key indexing.
3. **Linked Lists and Arrays**: Used in managing memory pages and data blocks.

### Example: B+ Tree Structure in a Database

A **B+ tree** is a balanced tree structure often used in databases for indexing. Each node can have multiple children, making B+ trees highly efficient for disk-based storage.

#### Example in Go: B+ Tree-Like Structure

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Basic B+ Tree-like node structure
type BPTreeNode struct {
    keys   []int
    values []string
}

// Insert function to add key-value pairs
func (node *BPTreeNode) Insert(key int, value string) {
    node.keys = append(node.keys, key)
    node.values = append(node.values, value)
}

// Search function to find value by key
func (node *BPTreeNode) Search(key int) string {
    for i, k := range node.keys {
        if k == key {
            return node.values[i]
        }
    }
    return "Not Found"
}

func main() {
    node := &BPTreeNode{}
    node.Insert(10, "Value A")
    node.Insert(20, "Value B")

    fmt.Println("Search for key 10:", node.Search(10))
}
```

In this example, we define a simple B+ tree-like structure to store key-value pairs and provide search functionality.
