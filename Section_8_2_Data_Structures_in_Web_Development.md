## Importance of Data Structures in Web Development

In web development, data structures are essential for managing data flow between the server and client, organizing caching mechanisms, and handling large volumes of data efficiently. Frontend and backend systems leverage various data structures to improve performance and user experience.

### Common Data Structures in Web Development

1. **Hash Tables**: Used for caching data, managing session storage, and providing quick access to frequently accessed items.
2. **Stacks and Queues**: Useful for managing navigation history, handling asynchronous tasks, and managing request handling.
3. **Graphs**: Represent connections between users, entities, or other resources, often used in social networks.

### Example: Queue for Task Management in Web Development

Queues are commonly used in backend web systems for task management, such as processing requests or managing background jobs.

#### Example in Go: Queue for Task Handling

```go
package main

import (
    "container/list"
    "fmt"
)

type Queue struct {
    queue *list.List
}

// NewQueue initializes a new queue
func NewQueue() *Queue {
    return &Queue{queue: list.New()}
}

// Enqueue adds a task to the queue
func (q *Queue) Enqueue(task string) {
    q.queue.PushBack(task)
}

// Dequeue removes a task from the queue
func (q *Queue) Dequeue() string {
    if q.queue.Len() == 0 {
        return "Queue is empty"
    }
    element := q.queue.Front()
    q.queue.Remove(element)
    return element.Value.(string)
}

func main() {
    queue := NewQueue()
    queue.Enqueue("Task 1")
    queue.Enqueue("Task 2")
    fmt.Println("Processing:", queue.Dequeue())
    fmt.Println("Processing:", queue.Dequeue())
}
```

In this example, a `Queue` struct is used to manage tasks, demonstrating how backend systems can handle jobs sequentially.
