## Role of Data Structures in AI and Machine Learning

Data structures play an essential role in handling, storing, and processing large volumes of data in AI and machine learning applications. Efficient data structures support the storage and retrieval of data, feature extraction, and graph-based network analysis.

### Common Data Structures in AI and Machine Learning

1. **Matrices and Tensors**: Represent multidimensional data, essential for neural networks and deep learning.
2. **Graphs**: Used to represent relationships and connections, such as in social networks or recommendation systems.
3. **Trees and Heaps**: Trees (like decision trees) are used in classification models, and heaps support priority-based data processing.

### Example: Matrix Multiplication for Data in Machine Learning

Matrices are fundamental in representing data and operations in machine learning. Below is an example of matrix addition in Go, a common operation in linear algebra and neural networks.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func addMatrices(a, b [][]int) [][]int {
    rows, cols := len(a), len(a[0])
    result := make([][]int, rows)
    for i := range result {
        result[i] = make([]int, cols)
        for j := range result[i] {
            result[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j]
        }
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    matrixA := [][]int{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
    matrixB := [][]int{{5, 6}, {7, 8}}
    result := addMatrices(matrixA, matrixB)
    fmt.Println("Matrix addition result:", result)
}
```

In this example, `addMatrices` performs element-wise addition on two matrices.
