# 7.2 Implementing Custom Data Structures

## Why Implement Custom Data Structures?

Sometimes, standard data structures don’t meet the specific needs of an application, so implementing a custom data structure can provide optimized performance and specialized functionality. Custom data structures allow developers to address unique use cases and requirements efficiently.

### Steps to Implement a Custom Data Structure

1. **Define the Operations**: Outline the operations required, such as insertion, deletion, and search.
2. **Choose an Underlying Structure**: Decide if you will use arrays, linked lists, trees, or a combination as the base.
3. **Optimize for Performance**: Consider time and space complexity when implementing each operation.
4. **Test**: Verify your structure with various data and scenarios to ensure reliability.

### Example in Go: Custom Priority Queue

A **priority queue** is a data structure where each element is assigned a priority, and the element with the highest priority is served before others.

#### Priority Queue Implementation

```go
package main

import (
    "container/heap"
    "fmt"
)

// Item is a structure representing an element with priority
type Item struct {
    value    string
    priority int
}

// PriorityQueue implements heap.Interface and holds Items
type PriorityQueue []*Item

func (pq PriorityQueue) Len() int { return len(pq) }
func (pq PriorityQueue) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return pq[i].priority > pq[j].priority // Higher priority first
}
func (pq PriorityQueue) Swap(i, j int) {
    pq[i], pq[j] = pq[j], pq[i]
}
func (pq *PriorityQueue) Push(x interface{}) {
    *pq = append(*pq, x.(*Item))
}
func (pq *PriorityQueue) Pop() interface{} {
    old := *pq
    n := len(old)
    item := old[n-1]
    *pq = old[0 : n-1]
    return item
}

func main() {
    pq := &PriorityQueue{
        &Item{value: "task1", priority: 3},
        &Item{value: "task2", priority: 1},
    }
    heap.Init(pq)
    heap.Push(pq, &Item{value: "task3", priority: 2})

    fmt.Println("Highest priority task:", heap.Pop(pq).(*Item).value)
}
```

In this example, we define a custom priority queue using Go’s `container/heap` package.

### Advantages of Custom Data Structures

- **Tailored for Specific Needs**: Custom data structures can be optimized to perform only the necessary operations, often resulting in better performance.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: They allow adding custom functionality that might not be available in standard structures.

### Limitations of Custom Data Structures

- **Complexity**: Custom implementations require careful design and testing to ensure they perform efficiently.
- **Maintenance**: Custom data structures may require more maintenance and documentation.
