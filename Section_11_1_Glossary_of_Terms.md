# 11.1 Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms covered in this guide on data structures.

### Key Terms

- **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**: A model of a data structure that specifies the behavior (operations) without detailing the implementation.
- **Array**: A collection of items stored in contiguous memory locations, accessible by indices.
- **Big O Notation**: A mathematical notation that describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity.
- **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure where each node has up to two children.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree with the property that each node's left child has a lesser value and the right child has a greater value.
- **Cache**: A small-sized type of fast and temporary storage used to store frequently accessed data.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that maps keys to values, allowing for fast data retrieval based on keys.
- **Heap**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, commonly used in priority queues.
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where each element (node) contains a reference (link) to the next element.
- **Queue**: A linear structure following First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering.
- **Stack**: A linear structure following Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) ordering.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used to store strings and support prefix-based searching.
